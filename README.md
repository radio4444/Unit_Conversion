# Project 1 - *Unit Conversion*

**Unit Conversion** is Conversion of Units is a multi-step process that converts units of measurement for the same quantity.

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following things are in the unit conversion:

- [x] There are five types of unit conversion: Length, Mass, Temperature, Time and Pressure. 
- [x] Currently, each of them has only one-unit conversion. 
- [x] Length – Kilometer to Miles
- [x] Mass – Kilogram to Pound
- [x] Temperature – Fahrenheit to Celsius 
- [x] Time – Minute to second
- [x] Pressure – Bar to Pascal
- [x] In order use another unit conversion, you have to re-run the program.

## Video Walkthrough

There is a 2 minutes and 19 seconds of video attach to this project

## Notes
During the project, I had no idea, where to start this project. Since, it was my first program that I did program scratch. I already had this idea to create unit conversion project on my first day of Phy 205, when my professor told us to create a program, which is related to physics. I have to say through, it was fun doing this project, as we can choose our own topic. 
So, I asked my professor, what he wants and told me to have at least five different type of unit conversion. Like I mentioned before, since it was my first project from scratch, I searched online, if I can find template of this project. But later I decided, why not actually I do it all by myself. And, I had to review java, since I am not taking any java or any other program class. And voila, here is my first program. Later in the future, I want to improve this project more, I would like to push my limits and review my java language. In fact, I already have decided to create an android app of replica of this project. Thank you for reading this note and using my project.
